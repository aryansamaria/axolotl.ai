Sending money basics,How long does a transfer usually take?,"Every transfer will take a different amount of time depending on a few things. We always move your money as quickly as possible, but the speed will be affected by things like the currency you’re sending to and from, how you pay for it, and banking hours. To get a general estimate, you can put some currency details into our transfer calculator while logged in and it’ll show you how long it might take.When you actually set up your transfer on Wise, your estimate will likely change — this is because the more information we have about your transfer, the more accurately we can tell you how long it’ll take. Here are some things that can affect how long your transfer takes.ConversionWhatever currency you’re sending, converting your money can always take up to 2 working days. The countries you’re sending to and from Every currency and country is different. How quickly your transfer arrives to your recipient depends on how quickly your recipient’s bank can process the payment, as well as the ways you paid in the country you’re sending from. After the payment has been sent out of Wise, we can't confirm when the money has reached your recipient's bank, so you’ll need to ask your recipient directly.How you payThe way you pay for your transfer can also affect the speed of your transfer. Some payment methods are quicker than others. For instance, card payments are normally instant, while bank transfers can take longer, especially if you’re paying by Swift. We'll show you how long each payment method takes when you set up your transfer.Public holidays and banking hours We can only move your money during normal banking hours. So if you send money outside of those hours, it may take longer than usual. National holidays can also affect the transfer speed, so if you’re sending to a different country, make sure to check that it doesn’t fall on a holiday.Security checks As a regulated institution, we also need to make sure we run regular security checks on our customers and their payments. We might need to verify things like your ID, address, or where you got the money from, when you make a transfer. These additional checks can add extra time to your transfer.You can't speed this up, and we'll get in touch if we need anything from you, but you can always check the status of your transfer from the web or app.",https://wise.com/help/articles/2524078/how-long-does-a-transfer-usually-take

Sending money basics,Sending with Swift,"If you're sending a payment in a currency that's different from your recipient's bank's currency, you'll need to send it by Swift. An example is if you're sending USD to a country outside of the US. Swift payments, also called international wires, are a type of international transfer sent with the Swift international payment network. The Swift international payment network is one of the largest financial messaging systems in the world. Wise can send or receive certain currencies via Swift payment.Find out how to send to recipients with Swift, what the fees are, and how long it can take.When do you use Swift?We pay out via Swift when you send:USD to countries outside the USGBP to countries outside the UKMore than 1 million JPY to any countryEUR to banks that are not part of SEPA and countries outside of SEPAWhat do I need to know when sending with Swift?Here's a few things that can help make your transfer experience smoother.Use an IBANWhen sending out a Swift payment, always use an IBAN when possible. You can use our IBAN checker to see if a country supports IBAN numbers and what its structure means.Daily cumulative limitIf your profile address is in Australia, Japan or United States, there's a daily cumulative limit of 5 million GBP — or equivalent in your country. It means you can send up to 5 million GBP or equivalent to different Swift recipients in different currencies within one day. If your address is outside of these three regions, then regular Swift transaction-based limits apply.Existing recipientIf you've sent a Swift payment to a recipient in the past, you can select them from the available recipients list when setting up your payment.New recipientFirst, always ask your recipient to double-check the details they're giving you are correct before you use them.Our system then uses recipient validation to check that the details are valid and comply with Swift rules. When you start setting up the payment, the system checks the name, address, bank account number, and the Swift or BIC number of your recipient. This helps us prevent rejected transfers or delays with your payments and give you a better Swift experience.Inputting details correctlyIt's easy to type information into the wrong field. But this can lead to errors and delays. For example, in the account number field, only input the account number — not any additional details, like your recipient's name or Swift code.Make sure you don't use any spaces or separators in the number.What are the fees for Swift payments?We’ll charge you to send out a Swift payment — check our pricing page on the latest fees for your region.When the money is in transit, correspondent banks in between may also deduct their own handling fees. We can't control what extra costs other banks apply.Learn more about correspondent bank feesHow long can a Swift transfer take?Swift payments usually take 1–6 working days to reach their destination, but it's possible they can take longer due to time differences between the sending and receiving country, or multiple intermediary banks involved with delivering your money to us.My recipient's account details didn't workIf the system spots incorrect details, it'll prompt you to review them before continuing with the payment.There are some unique account numbers that sometimes don't work with our system. If you're sure it's a valid number — contact us with a proof of account from your recipient. We'll try to create a custom rule for your situation. A proof of account validity can be an invoice or statement from the recipient's bank that shows the bank account number.*The speed of your transfers always depends on individual circumstances, and may not be available for all transactions",https://wise.com/help/articles/5Fwvk7KFzbTBohJiUu0Ryd/sending-with-swift
Sending money basics,Do I need to pay any tax on transfers?,"Wise may have to levy tax on its transfer fee according to local tax laws. For example, Brazilian real (BRL) transactions where IOF (Imposto sobre Operações Financeiras — financial operations tax) may be imposed by our banking partner(s). Where transactional taxes apply, these will either be included in the fee payable or shown separately at the time of payment, and won’t impact the amount sent to the recipient.Wise will pay out the agreed amount to the recipient and won’t withhold any taxes on money you transfer. Depending on the nature of a transfer, you and/or the recipient may need to declare and pay tax. Wise can’t advise whether tax applies to your transfer and we recommend that you ask a financial advisor and/or the relevant tax authority.",https://wise.com/help/articles/2565007/do-i-need-to-pay-any-tax-on-transfers

To check the money tracker:Log in to your Wise accountClick Details on the transfer you’d like to trackToday, we deliver over 80% of transfers within 2 hours of the estimated time you see on the money tracker. But sometimes, it can take a little longer.

If we do, we’ll send you an email letting you know what information we need. So, keep an eye on your emails whenever you set up a transfer.The recipient’s bank might be processing the transferWhen the money tracker says Transfer Sent, it means Wise has sent out your money. But, it can still take a few working days for it to reach the recipient’s bank, and for them to process it. The extra time it takes also depends on the currency you’re sending to. Check your currency for how long it can take for the money to arrive to your recipient. There’s a mistake in the recipient’s detailsSometimes, transfers get delayed because there’s a mistake in the recipient’s details. When this happens, some banks can still process the transfer, but it takes a little longer for them to match it to the right account. Other times, they’ll send the money back to us and we’ll ask you to send it again.If your transfer is taking longer than you expect, double check the recipient’s details. Here’s what to do if you made a mistake.It's a weekend or holidayIf you're sending money over the weekend or before a holiday, it may only get processed the next working day.

Where is my money?,When will my money arrive?,"When you make a transfer, we’ll give you an estimate for when your money should arrive. But, there are a few situations where you might have questions about timing. Here are some tips to help you understand when it’ll arrive, or why it’s delayed.Wise says that my transfer’s due to arrive today. Great! Really that means your money should’ve arrived already. We say that it’s due today because some banks need a few hours to process transfers from us. My recipient’s details may be wrong. Small things like typos in names — for instance, spelling John Smith as Jon Smith — shouldn’t be a problem for most countries. Your money should still arrive on time. However, for some currencies, such as JPY, a typo like this can be an issue. If something like an account number is wrong, your money could take longer to arrive, or get returned to us. If your money does get returned to us, we’ll let you know straight away. Transfers on weekends and holidays.Not all countries have banking systems that work on weekends or holidays. Our delivery times factor in banking hours of the country you’re sending money to.But in some parts of the world, banks stop processing transfers early on Fridays.That means, if your money’s due to arrive on Friday, it may not show in your recipient’s account until the next working day. We’re working to find out which banks do this, and make our delivery estimates more accurate in the process.My recipient says the money hasn’t arrived yet.We hope to never put you in this position. If your recipient says they haven’t received your money yet, please ask them to check the following:The sender name they’re looking for. Your recipient can try looking for a transaction on their bank statement from Wise — they might not see your name. The transfer might also come from one of our partners, but the amount and reference should still help find the payout.The recipient’s bank details. If they’re not right, your money could take longer to arrive, or get returned to us. The currency the recipient’s account is in. Your recipient’s account may be in a currency that’s different to the one you’ve sent them. If that’s the case, they could get a different amount from us because their bank might have converted the money.Getting a receipt.Your recipient’s bank may be having problems processing your transfer. They’ll have the money in their system, but won’t have put it into your recipient’s account. Our receipt includes all our bank details and, for some currencies, tracking numbers too. That means when your recipient gives it to their bank, the bank should have all the info they need to track down your transfer.

Where is my money?,Why do some transfers take longer?,"We try to send your transfer out as soon as possible, but sometimes, it might take longer.

Note that any transfer with conversion can take 2 working days to process.

You can check the status of your transfer in the app.So if your transfer is urgent, plan around weekends and public holidays.Mistake in your recipient detailsWe all make mistakes, and sometimes we might input one wrong digit or misspell a name. If this happens, the recipient's bank will likely reject the payment and it will be sent back to your account details by that bank. This can take up to a few days depending on the currency, payment method, and whether it's outside of the bank's working hours.Security checks From time to time, we need to run security checks on all of our customers and their payments. This is because we're a regulated financial institution, and are required to review transfers by law. We might need to verify things like your ID, address, or where you got the money from, when you make a transfer. These additional checks can add extra time to your transfer.

At this point, the money’s out of our system, so we can’t control how they manage the payment, but the bank should be able to help.Your recipient can ask the receiving bank to clear the money faster. Just share the transfer receipt with your recipient that they can show their bank to get information. We can’t share any details about the sent payment with your recipient directly. We’re trying to identify the banks that are slower, so we can give you a more accurate estimate.

Mistakes and editing your transfer,Why was I charged extra?,"It’s never nice to get charged more than you were expecting. There are three main reasons this could happen when you use a card to pay for a transfer. The bank that issued your card has charged an extra fee — often called a ‘cash advance’Some banks charge an extra fee when you use your card for a transfer. It works like this:When you pay for your transfer, Wise assigns a number called a Merchant Category Code (MCC) to your payment. MCCs help financial institutions categorise the kind of payment they’re processing. Wise passes this MCC on to your bank — it’s always 4829 or 6012, which indicates that your payment is a ‘wire’ or ‘money order’.Once the MCC we’ve assigned reaches your bank, they can choose how to charge for it. Some banks charge a fee for certain MCCs.For instance, banks sometimes charge your transfer as a ‘cash advance’ or ‘cash withdrawal’. And this could come with an extra charge. Wise doesn’t support this practice. But unfortunately, we have no control over it. It’s totally at the discretion of the bank that issued your card.Tip: Call your bank and check how they charge for the MCC assigned to your payment. If they’ve charged it as a cash advance or cash withdrawal, ask them why — and explain that the payment was not cash-related. They may be able to help.The card was in a different currency than the currency you sent fromHere’s an example: imagine you’ve sent GBP to USD. But the card you used was linked to a bank account that holds EUR.Because the currency you paid with (EUR) was different to the currency you sent from (GBP), your bank converts your money when you pay, and uses its own exchange rate. This is not the Wise rate, and we have no control over it. It’s likely to add an extra cost on top of your Wise fee. Tip: Always pay with a card that uses the same currency as the currency you’re sending from. You’ve used a more expensive card — like a credit or corporate cardHere’s an example: imagine you set up your transfer on Wise. You choose to pay with your debit card, and we show you the fee upfront. But when you actually pay, you enter the details of your credit card.Your transfer will still go through. But because you paid with a different type of card, you might be charged differently. That’s because in some countries, different cards have different fees on Wise. Generally, credit cards and corporate cards might be more expensive. If this happens, we’ll send you a notification telling you how you’ve been charged. Tip: We’ll always show you our fees clearly and transparently — and it may be cheaper to use a consumer debit card.",https://wise.com/help/articles/2977994/why-was-i-charged-extra

Cancellations and refunds,Why was my transfer cancelled?,"Sometimes, Wise will cancel your transfer. There are a few reasons why we might do this, and here are some of the most common ones.You didn’t pay for the transferIf you set up a transfer and don’t pay for it within 2 weeks, we’ll automatically cancel it. If you’d still like to make that transfer — you can just set up a new one.You won’t get the same rate as the original transfer you set up. This is because we only guarantee the rate for a specific period of time, which we show you when you create your transfer. The rate and time depends on the currency you send and how you pay for it. So if your transfer was cancelled for this reason, the original rate would have already expired within those two weeks.We need more information from youSometimes we need more information from you to send out your transfer.

Always check your recipient’s details carefully every time you make a transfer. Learn what to do if you made a mistakeYou didn’t set up a transferSometimes, people send us money without setting up a transfer first. This means we get your money, but can’t send it anywhere.

If this happens, ask your recipient to check with their bank — they'll be able to help. What to do if your transfer was cancelledDepending on the reason it was cancelled, and if we’ve sent you an email or instructions to follow, then just reply or follow the instructions so we can resume the transfer.If the window of time to action the instructions is closed, or we can’t resume this transfer — just set up a new one the way you did the first time, and keep an eye on your inbox just in case.",https://wise.com/help/articles/2971425/why-was-my-transfer-cancelled
Cancellations and refunds,Why can cancelling transfers increase fees?,"Every time someone transfers money with Wise, they pay a fee that covers the cost of that transfer. For example, the operational effort to move the money, and exchange it. When you cancel a transfer, some of those costs still happen. But you don’t pay the transfer fee anymore. This means that if too many people cancel, Wise may have to increase our fees to cover the gap. On the other hand, if people cancel less often, we’ll be able to pass those savings on by reducing fees in the future, as we’ve done in the past. Our price is always fair and always based on our cost. What else happens if I cancel too often?If you cancel too often, you’ll also lose access to your guaranteed rate. This means that you’ll get the live rate when we receive your money. How can I avoid cancelling transfers?One way to avoid cancelling transfers is to open a balance and add the money you want to transfer there. You can then convert it at any time, instantly — and depending on the currencies you’re sending between, it usually costs less than making a transfer. Check out how much you could save. Another option is Auto Conversions. Set your desired exchange rate, and we’ll convert the money automatically when it hits that point. You’ll need to have money in your Wise account to do this. Something went wrong with my transfer — is it OK to cancel?We understand that sometimes, things can go wrong. And that’s what the cancellation option is for. So, it’s totally OK to cancel if you have to — just be careful not to cancel too often.",https://wise.com/help/articles/2978072/why-can-cancelling-transfers-increase-fees

Check the tables below for detailed info. How does Swift work?Sending money with the Swift payment messaging network is like travelling from one airport to another — it’s not always possible to take a direct flight, so you may need to travel from city to city via several connecting flights.Swift works the same way. The money will travel from one country to another through correspondent banks. These correspondent banks often charge their own fees.We’ve built a prediction tool based on the correspondent banks’ historical fees and speed. If it suggests your payment will be charged, we include the fee when calculating your transfer cost.On this page we show you our fees in USD for easy comparison. Keep in mind that we’ll always take the fees in the currency you’re sending from. So, if you’re paying in EUR, we’ll charge the fees in EUR as well, but it'll be equivalent to the USD fees we calculated.

If you don’t hold a balance in the currency you’re planning to send money from, we’ll open one for you. You'll have to transfer money to this balance first, before we send it to your recipient.When should I schedule my payments?You can schedule your payments any time as long as it's 2 days ahead. You can't set your scheduled payment for the same day or the day after.So if your transfer is time-sensitive and you're paying from your Wise balance, we recommend scheduling it at least 3 days in advance. This is also because the date selected will be when the transfer gets sent out, not necessarily when your recipient will receive the money.We’ll remind you to make sure you have enough money in your balance, or bank account, for your transfer before your scheduled date.Turn on notifications for updates about your transferWhat happens to my transfer on the scheduled date?If your scheduled transfer is sent directly from your balanceThe scheduled date of your transfer is the day we send the money to your recipient — not the day they receive it. Your recipient should get the money within 3 working days from the scheduled date.Sending money from your external bank accountThe scheduled date of your transfer is the day we pull money from your account — not the day your recipient receives it.It usually takes 1-4 working days for your money to reach us. You will see the debit in your bank account usually within 2-3 working days of making the transfer.Sending money during for a holiday or non-working day It depends on your payment method and the country you're sending money to. Some banks don’t process transfers during weekends or bank holidays , so we’ll send out your money on the next working day. In others, for example the UK, transfers are 24/7. Scheduling a monthly transfer on the 30th or 31st, and the upcoming month has less daysYour transfer will be sent on the last day of that month. For example, if you schedule a monthly transfer on 30 January, but February only has 28 days — your transfer will be sent on the 28th.Can I edit a scheduled transfer?We can't change the details of a scheduled transfer. If you need to make changes, please cancel the transfer and set up a new one with the correct details.How can I check my scheduled transfers?You can check the status of your scheduled transfer on the web or app:Go to Payments Go to Scheduled transfersHow much money will my recipient get? When you set up your scheduled transfer, you can pay a fixed amount or set a fixed amount that your recipient will get.If you pay a fixed amount, we’ll show you an estimate of what your recipient will get. But because the rate might be different on the day of your scheduled transfer, your recipient could receive more or less. When your transfer is sent, you can check how much your recipient received by going to Scheduled Transfers under Payments and selecting the transfer.Note: If you’re paying for your scheduled transfer from your Wise balance, we recommend adding more money than the transfer amount ahead of time. This is because exchange rates fluctuate, resulting in the recipient getting less money, or for the transfer to fail due to insufficient funds. Will I get a guaranteed rate?The short answer is no, you won’t get a guaranteed rate. This is because you’re requesting that we send the money out later, and we can’t predict the future — as much as we wish we could.We’ll send out your transfer on the morning of the scheduled date, using the current mid-market rate at the time.Learn more about the mid-market rateMy scheduled transfer failed​​There are a few reasons why your transfer might fail.

Sending large transfers,What if I want to send more than my bank allows?,"Your bank may limit the amount you can send in one transfer, or in one day. This can make it hard to send large amounts — but here are some ways to make it easier.Go to your bank branch in personYou can send larger amounts in one go if you go to your bank in person, rather than doing it online or over the phone.It’s a good option if your bank is easy to get to, and you need to send money fast.Call your bank to increase the limitSome banks let you increase your limits for a short amount of time, like 24 hours. Give your bank a call to see if they’ll let you do this.This is a good option if it’s hard for you to get to your bank in person, and you need to send money fast. But not all banks do it.Add several smaller amounts to your balance, over a few daysTo do this, open a balance in your Wise account. Then, add money to it over several days and hold it in your balance. Once you’ve added the full amount, go ahead and make your transfer. Or, set up a transfer for the full amount and pay for it in several, smaller amountsIf you’d prefer not to open a balance, you can still set up a normal transfer for the full amount — and pay for it in several smaller amounts. To do this, set up your transfer as usual. Then pay in the first of the several, smaller amounts. This will trigger an email asking if:you’ve made a mistake if your bank has limits and you’re paying for your transfer in several smaller amountsFollow the instructions in your email to tell us you’ll be paying several smaller amounts. Keep in mind that if you pay for your transfer over several days, your guaranteed rate is likely to expire. This is because your rate is only guaranteed for specific period of time showed at a time of transfer created, and we can only keep that rate if we get the full amount within that timeframe.Tip: The email you get at this stage is sent automatically — so it may be faster and smoother to arrange your transfer through this email, than it's to get in touch with us.

Sending large transfers,Tips for getting started with large transfers,"It can be daunting to send a lot of money abroad. So when you make a large transfer, we make things as easy as possible.Here are some tips to help you get started.Understand your banking limits, or pay in-branchYour bank might limit the amount of money you can send per day, or per transfer. Those limits might differ if you’re sending online, over the phone, or in-branch. If you’re sending online or over the phone, your bank might limit the amount you can send in one go. That means you’ll need to send several smaller transfers over the course of a few days instead — and you might miss out on the rate.Your bank might let you send a bigger amount if you go in-person, to your branch. So it’s often quicker, and simpler, to set up larger transfers in-branch. You can download a PDF with all your transfer details to make this easier. Tip: Contact your bank to find out your limits for sending money.​Verify your identity beforehand to avoid delays When you send money with Wise, we’ll ask to verify your identity. We do this by checking your photo ID and address. It usually takes about 2 working days. If you set up your transfer before getting verified, we’ll do these checks before we send your money. So to avoid delays, get verified beforehand.After you pay for your transfer, we might need to see more documents. That’s because when you send a large amount, we need to verify where the money came from. It could be a scan/screenshot of your bank statement, a property sale agreement, or a pay slip. Tip: Get verified before making your first big transfer.Send us proof of your joint accountIf you’re sending money from a joint account, send us proof that you’re one of the account holders. It’s quicker to do this before you set up your transfer.By sharing proof that your account is in the same name used on your Wise account, and has the same account number as your transfer, you’ll help us keep your transfer moving smoothly. Tip: Send us a scan or screenshot of a recent bank statement with your name and account details.What if I need additional support?

Sending large transfers,How much does it cost to send large transfers?,"We always use the real exchange rate and charge a transparent fee, no matter how much money you send with us. And the more you send with us, the more you save on fees.All mentions of day and month in this article are based on London UTC time.How do our fees work? When you send over 20,000 GBP (or equivalent in your currency) over a calendar month, you’ll get a lower fee on the amount you send over the limit.The lower fee applies to one-time transfers or multiple completed transfers in the same month. How do I get the discounted fees? We'll automatically apply the discounted rate to your transfers or balance conversions as long as you: send over 20,000 GBP (or equivalent) within a calendar month*convert between currencies (e.g. GBP to EUR)It doesn’t matter how many currencies you send to and from — you can still get the lower fee.Sending transfers in the same currency won't count (e.g. if you send USD to USD) and pay with one of the supported currencies for discounted fees*. See below for the list of applicable currencies. *Only completed transfers or conversions are counted towards the volume. If you set up transfers, but don't complete them, they won't count. How much is the fee?The more you send, the lower your fee is. This table shows the estimated percentage discount depending on your monthly volume.Volume (GBP)Discount (%)0–20k020k–300k0.1300k–500k0.15500k–1m0.161m+0.17If you're sending or converting more than 2m GBP or equivalent read more info here. This works a bit like tax brackets. So, just like you pay no tax on the first part of your income, then a progressively higher percentage on the next part of your income — you only get the lower fee on the amount that falls in each bracket. The thresholds are calculated in GBP. So, if you normally send USD or any other currency, we’ll work out whether you’re in the bracket to get a lower fee using the live exchange rate. You don’t need to work the fee out yourself. We’ll always automatically apply it to your transfer. An example of how the fee worksAll the numbers used in this section are examples only. The actual numbers can vary.Let’s say that in September, you send 2 transfers of 20,000 GBP to EUR, and 1 transfer of 500 GBP to EUR.On the first transfer, we’ll charge our normal fee for sending GBP to EUR by bank transfer, which is 0.33%. There’s no discount on it, because it’s the limit for the first bracket of 20,000 GBP.On the second and third transfers, we’ll charge 0.23%, because you’re in the second bracket and now qualify for the lower fee. So even when you’re sending smaller amounts in September, you’ll get the lower fee as long as the initial limits for each bracket have been met.If you send that 40,500 GBP in one go instead of in 3 transfers, you’ll get the same average fee.It will be calculated as follows:1. 20,000 GBP * 0.33% = 66 GBP2. 20,500 GBP * 0.23% = 47.2 GBPTotal = 113.2 GBP for the fees.Remember: A transfer needs to be completed before the end of the same month to qualify for lower fees, as the threshold resets for the following month.You can calculate your average fee here.Learn more about sending large amounts with WiseSupported currencies*In order to get the discounted fees, the currency you pay with must be AED, ARS, AUD, BGN, BRL, CAD, CHF, CNY, CZK, DKK, EUR, GBP, HKD, HUF, IDR, INR, JPY, MYR, NOK, NZD, PHP, PLN, RON, SEK, SGD, TRY, UAH, or USD.

Rates and fees,Fees for sending money,"To see exactly how much your transfer could cost, visit our pricing page. Or read on for a bit more detail on how we work the price of your transfer out.How much a transfer costs depends on three things — the amount you’re sending, how you pay, and the exchange rate. The amount you’re sendingThe more money you send, the more your transfer costs. That’s because the Wise fee is worked out as a percentage of the amount you’re sending. The percentage varies from currency to currency, and you can check it on our pricing page. The exception to this is if you’re sending a small amount of money, in which case there’s a cheap, minimum fee. How you payThere are different ways to pay depending on the country you’re sending from. You’ll see how much each payment method or type of transfer costs when you set up your transfer. Sending same-currency transfers between Wise balances is free.The exchange rateYou always get the mid-market rate — it’s the one banks use to trade between themselves. Because we never mark this rate up, your recipient typically gets more money at the other end. The mid-market exchange rate is always moving. So for some of our currencies, you can lock in the rate you see when you set your transfer up — and you’re guaranteed to get it, as long as we receive the total amount in the stated timeframe.Learn more about guaranteed rates",https://wise.com/help/articles/2522717/fees-for-sending-money
Rates and fees,What's a guaranteed rate?,"A guaranteed rate is exactly what you’d expect: an exchange rate that’s guaranteed for a specified period of time. We offer a guaranteed rate to most transfers. When currency markets are volatile, we may not be able to do so. You can still send money using live rate transfers.As you finish setting up your transfer, we’ll guarantee your rate for a certain period of time. It’s important that you send your money to us right away so we receive your money on time. As long as we receive your money on time, you’ll get that rate locked.If your money doesn’t reach us in time, we’ll still convert and send it as soon as possible. But we’ll use the mid-market rate instead.Click here for info if you can't set up guaranteed rate transfers anymore.How does it work? How long is the rate guaranteed on my transfer?We guarantee your rate long enough for your money to get to us. It depends on the currency you’re sending from. We’ll always tell you how long the rate is guaranteed for when you set your transfer up.The guaranteed rate will be honoured once we received the full amount needed for your transfer, within the time specified.What if I don’t pay by bank transfer?Some payment methods, for example ACH Direct Debit in the US, work differently. If you pay for a transfer or a balance top up with one of these methods, your rate is locked in when you successfully paid, or when you authorised the payment to Wise. In most cases, these payments are very fast, so this won't affect your rate. How many transfers can I set up with a guaranteed rate?You can’t set up an unlimited number of transfers with a guaranteed rate. And you should only set up a transfer if you intend to complete it. If you created multiple transfers but only paid for one of them, we’ll assign your deposit to the first transfer you created. You can cancel any transfer you don’t intend to complete and leave just one active, so we know where to assign your money to.Keep in mind that if you remain at one step of the transfer setup process for more than 30 minutes, the guaranteed rate will refresh.It’s not possible to set up an unlimited number of transfers with a guaranteed rate. You should only set up a transfer if you intend to complete it. What if my transfer falls on a weekend?In most countries, banks don’t process transfers over the weekend — they start paying them out on the following working day. Because of this, we usually don’t count the weekend when we calculate guaranteed rates. For example, if your transfer has a 48-hour guaranteed rate, and you set up your transfer on Friday, at 5:00pm, your rate will be guaranteed until Tuesday at 5:00 pm. If we do guarantee your rate over the weekend, you’ll see this when you set your transfer up. Note: weekends in some countries, such as the UAE, are Friday and Saturday. In this case, we’d send out your money on the Sunday.What rate do I get if I set up a transfer on the weekend?Because the market closes on a Friday, we don’t give new rates over the weekend. So, if you set up a transfer on a weekend, you’ll get the last rate before the market closed on the Friday. We stop getting live rates at 5pm New York time, and we start getting live rates again at 9am Auckland time. Missing the guaranteed rate and rate changes.What if I miss my guaranteed rate?If your money reaches us after your guaranteed rate lock has expired, we’ll use the live rate at the time we receive it. This means that if your rate lock expires at 2pm, and your money reaches our account at 4pm, we’ll lock the live rate at 4pm and use that to send your money.For this reason, it’s usually best to get your money to us as soon as possible.It’s common for banks to have limits on the amount you can send online, and this often leads to Wise customers missing their guaranteed rate. To make sure you always get the rate you’ve locked, read our tips on sending money with your bank.What if the rate changes significantly in that time, or the rate is unstable? For any transfer with a guaranteed rate, there's a 5% rate limit. If the rate changes by 5% or more during the guaranteed rate period, we reserve the right to cancel and refund your transfer — we’ll send the money back to the account it came from. Sometimes, markets can be volatile. This means we may need to set temporary limits on the amount of money you can send with the guaranteed rate, even if the movement is under 5%. You'll see a notification for this when trying to send over the limit.When adding money to your balance from a different currency, just add the same currency first, and convert it to the one you want to send. This ensures we give you the best rate at the time.",https://wise.com/help/articles/2448203/whats-a-guaranteed-rate
Rates and fees,Why can't I set up guaranteed rate transfers anymore?,"If there’s been a violation of the Customer Agreement, we’ll remove the guaranteed rate feature from your account. This means you’ll no longer be able to set up a transfer with a guaranteed rate. What’s considered a violation of the Customer Agreement? This could involve setting up multiple transfers to get the best rate, or setting up and cancelling transfers without the intention of funding them at all. You should also not set up any transfers if you’re still waiting to receive money to fund them. Transfers should only be set up if you have the deposit amount available. If the guaranteed rate feature has been removed from my account, how can I get it back? Removal of this feature is not permanent. If you use Wise in line with the Customer Agreement, we may give you access to the feature once more. We can’t advise how long this will take — it’s dependent on your past and future transfer activity. How can I use Wise without the guaranteed rate?

Rates and fees,How do live rate transfers work?,"There are 2 types of exchange rates you can get on your transfer: a live rate, and a guaranteed rate. A live rate means that your transfer will be converted using the rate that's live at the time your money gets to Wise. It means that when you set up your transfer, you won't know exactly how much your recipient will get, because the rate will change in the time it takes your money to reach Wise from your bank account. How do I know if I've got a live rate for my transfer?Most of the time, your transfer will have a guaranteed rate. But sometimes, Wise can't offer you a guaranteed rate. This can happen if the exchange rate is really volatile. You can tell if your transfer is using the live rate, because when you set it up you'll see a message saying the exchange rate isn't guaranteed.What if I need to send an exact amount while the exchange rate isn't guaranteed?If there's no guaranteed rate, you won't be able to send an exact amount using the ""Recipient gets"" box. This is because the exchange rate will change between when you send us the money and when the recipient gets it, so we won't know how much to charge you. You can still send your recipient an exact amount if you need to. Here's how:Open a balance in the currency you have, and the currency you want your recipient to getAdd money to your balance in the currency you haveConvert that money to the currency you want your recipient to getSend the money straight from that currency to your recipientWhat if I don’t pay by bank transfer?Some payment methods, for example ACH Direct Debit in the US, work differently.

Rates and fees,What are dynamic charges?,"For the information on your account and transfer fees, check the Terms of Use for your region and our pricing page.When you transfer or convert money, you may see an additional type of charge in the calculator called a dynamic charge. We may add it when you’re sending or converting a currency that’s less used around the world, or when foreign exchange markets are volatile. We’ll always be upfront about our fees, so if you don’t see the dynamic charge in the calculator starting a new payment, it means it doesn’t apply to you. Will this mean an increase in prices? Dynamic charges don’t necessarily mean an increase in prices. In fact, it may mean a decrease. These charges show the latest cost of exchanging currencies — so they may go up or down. Why do we use dynamic charges?The fees you pay include the cost of currencies we buy or sell to move your money around. For most of them, this cost is relatively stable, but in some cases, it can change often and fast. When this happens, we often have to stop transactions with these currencies. That’s why sometimes we may show the dynamic charges to make sure our services remain available to you.",https://wise.com/help/articles/2amMyWoOyhgTL0CkDcY2m4/what-are-dynamic-charges
